A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes that are connected to each other in a specific order. Each node in the list contains data, as well as two pointers that point to the previous and next nodes in the list. This allows the list to be traversed in either direction, and for nodes to be easily added or removed at any point in the list.

Doubly linked lists are commonly used in computer programming to store and manipulate data in an efficient and flexible manner. They are particularly useful for applications that require the ability to quickly add or remove elements from the middle of the list, or to traverse the list in either direction.

In C, a doubly linked list can be implemented using a structure that defines the node and its data, as well as the pointers to the previous and next nodes in the list. The following example shows a simple implementation of a doubly linked list in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define the structure for a node in the doubly linked list
typedef struct dlistint_s
{
    int n;                      // Data contained in the node
    struct dlistint_s *prev;    // Pointer to the previous node in the list
    struct dlistint_s *next;
}
```
